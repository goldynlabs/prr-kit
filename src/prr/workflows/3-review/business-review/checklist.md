- [ ] Business risk evaluated for each 🔴 finding from prior reviews (SR, GR, PR, AR)
- [ ] Data and migration impact assessed (schema changes, storage migration, rollback plan)
- [ ] Observability gaps identified (analytics, error monitoring, logging, feature flags)
- [ ] Cross-cutting and deployment concerns reviewed (browser compat, API contracts, env parity)

## Finding Quality
